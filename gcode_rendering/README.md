# Rendering G-code

This script allows easy visualization of G-code files using Python.

Any development environment with Matplotlib and Numpy should be able to run this script. It is meant to be interactive.

Inside __gcode_rendering.py__, you can change the path to the G-code file you want to visualize.

## Running

    
```python gcode_rendering.py```

Then specify the layer you want to visualize. To exit, close the rendering window and type __exit__ in the terminal.
